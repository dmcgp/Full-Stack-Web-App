# Case Study: Task Manager

## Why
Small teams struggle to track projects, tasks, and feedback across chats and spreadsheets. This app centralizes work with permissions, boosting clarity and reducing context switching.

## What
- Auth: Users register, login, and manage sessions (JWT)
- CRUD: Projects, tasks, comments
- Observability: Logs and metrics
- Deployment: Frontend (Netlify/Vercel), Backend (Render/Fly.io)

## Impact
- Faster onboarding and better accountability
- Reduced time lost in scattered tools
